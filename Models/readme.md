# Developed Models

All the developed models were done using tinkercad (https://www.tinkercad.com/).

- XSupport is the attachment that connects the X stepper with the X slider.
- YSupport is the attachment that connects the Y stepper with the Y slider.
- The other Support files are used to hold the stepper motors in place, and may have to be modified depending on the steppers used.
- axisExtension3, which was used to extend the axis on the Y direction; courtesy of Prof. Dr. Lu√≠s Melo.

The original file is present here, named SYSTEM.

# Gear STLs

The Gear STLs which are part of this build were taken from https://zenodo.org/records/7845304, https://www.hardware-x.com/article/S2468-0672(23)00054-8/fulltext.

The X Mount (top) gears were scaled by x1.2 to fit into the AFM. The Y Mount (bottom) gears are identical to the ones in the original paper.

The Circuit folder contains a circuit diagram of the build, done in KiCad (circuit.png).

There is also a flowchart of the Arduino programme - Flowchart.drawio (made using app.diagrams.net), flowchart.png.
